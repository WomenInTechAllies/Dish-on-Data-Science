# Dish-on-Data-Science
9/26/18 Meetup

Hello Allies,

 

We had an amazing Data Panel discussion on Wednesday, Sept. 26th. A huge thank you again to our panelists, Dr. Zeydy Ortiz( https://buff.ly/2MHsj2p ), Kelly Curtin ( https://buff.ly/2MHsivn ),  Dr. Ada Tsoi ( https://buff.ly/2NPbuaI ), Rick Pack ( https://buff.ly/2D79sOW ), and Dr. Arun Gupta ( https://buff.ly/2QDI9yn ) for sharing their perspectives.

 

Unfortunately, we were unable to record the session,  however our panelists have shared  the list below of resources to help you nurture your inner data scientist.
 

## From Ada:

 

Coursera class: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science

 

Bootcamp intended for PhDs to transition to data science: https://www.thedataincubator.com/fellowship.html

 

Other resources:

https://codecademy.com
https://pgexercises.com
https://www.kaggle.com
 

## From Kelly:

 

Getting certified in  AWS is very valuable in the data space.as is other cloud options (although AWS has the greatest market share right now)  :https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?ref=home&src=ukw&q=AWS

 

Also take some data management classes: https://www.udemy.com/topic/database-management/

 

My favorite books on data model patterns:

https://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Model_Patterns.html?id=IUVsAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false
 

Strength Finder is a great way to find your strengths and put together a one page marketing plan to market not just what you have done but who you are

## From Arun:

 

I have successfully and frequently used EdX.org. Assignments and projects are still free you just don’t get an ‘official’ certificate.
 

## From Rick:

 

The Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science
 

Mara Averick, keynote speaker for the Research Triangle Analysts' 2018 "Analytics Forward" unconference has a fun and inspiring data science-focused (and R-focused) Twitter account: https://twitter.com/dataandme/ 
 

While not referenced during the panel
I find this web page of data visualizations (with R code!) quite helpful and idea-inspiring. Newcomers to R could use the code to visualize any data of their choosing: http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html
 

PacktPub offers a free e-book every day and they are often Python or R-focused. Quality varies. https://www.packtpub.com//packt/offers/free-learning?login=1
 

One more...and I hope Dr. Zeydy does not mind - I think she referenced her company's development of a chatbot to support GE's Brilliant Manufacturing suite. She discusses that chatbot as well as some Python strengths here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/converting-data-value-zeydy-ortiz-ph-d-/
 

 

## From Zeydy:

 

Coursera courses by local Duke data science leader, Dr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel: https://www.coursera.org/instructor/minecetinkayarundel

## From Alani:

 

As Discussed in the Panel being a good Data Science means developing some business acumen. I recommend The 10 Day MBA  by Steven A Silbiger: https://www.amazon.com/Ten-Day-MBA-4th-Step-Step/dp/0062199579/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1538430600&sr=8-1&keywords=the+10-day+mba
